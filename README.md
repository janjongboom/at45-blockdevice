# AT45 Block Device

Mbed OS 5 [BlockDevice](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/reference/blockdevice.html) driver for the AT45 SPI Dataflash chip. Based off [Steen JÃ¸rgensen's AT45 library](https://os.mbed.com/users/stjo2809/code/AT45/). You can use this driver together with the file system APIs in Mbed OS to mount a file system on your external flash, or just use the driver directly. Note that you can only do aligned operations on this block device.

Erase is disabled in this driver, due to issues. Use the driver above instead.

## Deinitialization

Mbed OS does not have a way to destruct a SPI interface once created. This causes issues with the AT45 when initializing it multiple times, like in a bootloader and then in an application. For this a `DeconstructableSPI` interface is used in this library. If you call `deinit` on the block device it will automatically uninitialize the SPI interface. Do this before jumping to the main program from a bootloader.
